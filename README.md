# Schwarz-4-Multiscale

This repository contains input files to run the Schwarz alternating method for multiscale coupling in solid mechanics in Albany-LCM, and supplements the following manuscript: A. Mota, I. Tezaur, G. Phlipot.  "The Schwarz alternating method for dynamic solid mechanics", submitted to Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng.  The input files stored here have been tested to work with the following version of Trilinos, Albany-LCM and DTK:

   * Trilinos (https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos): 7bc3b9f7fee156407cdb17b4e59b26f2c3ec9abb
   * Albany-LCM (https://github.com/sandialabs/LCM): fb72244e4c250a720735a2cc08629f9813a9552c 
   * DTK (https://github.com/ikalash/DataTransferKit): d9a5ccb81f404786a05d40b901c68877a17e356f

All test cases are designed to run with the AlbanyT executable.  For the test cases where .g mesh files are not provided, these can be generated by running CUBIT with the .jou files contained within the relevant subdirectory.

Contained also within this repository is a 1D MATLAB code that implements the Clamped (linear elastic wave propagation) problem.  This implementation allows one to run the Schwarz alternating method using different time-steps in different subdomains.
